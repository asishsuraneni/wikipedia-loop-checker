This project is a MERN stack application that analyzes the "Wikipedia Loop" phenomenon. It takes a Wikipedia URL as input and determines how many clicks (requests) it takes to reach the "Philosophy" page, while keeping track of all visited pages along the way.

Features
User-friendly React-based interface to enter a Wikipedia URL.
Analyzes the Wikipedia Loop and displays the number of clicks (requests) required to reach the "Philosophy" page.
Shows a list of visited Wikipedia pages in the order they were accessed.
Implemented with Node.js and Express as a backend API.
Dependencies
Node.js and npm
React (frontend)
Express, Axios, Cheerio (backend)
